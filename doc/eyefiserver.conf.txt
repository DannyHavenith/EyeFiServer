NAME
eyefiserver.conf - Settings file for eyefiserver

DESCRIPTION
/etc/eyefiserver.conf is organised in sections whose name are enclosed in brackets.

The global section is named [EyeFiServer]. The names of the other optionnal sections are the MAC address of the Eye-Fi card. The macaddress must be in lower case and without dashes. For exemple, if your card has a MAC address 00-18-56-50-ef-f9, the section should be named [00185650eff9].

All keys described bellow are searched first in the section specific to the Eye-Fi card, then, if not found, it is search in the global [EyeFiServer] section.

You don't need card specific section if you have only one Eye-Fi card.

There is only one compulsory key, the upload_key. See bellow.
