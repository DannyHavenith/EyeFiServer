NAME
eyefiserver.conf - Settings file for eyefiserver

DESCRIPTION
/etc/eyefiserver.conf is organised in sections whose name are enclosed in brackets.

The global section is named [EyeFiServer]. The names of the other optionnal sections are the MAC address of the Eye-Fi card. The macaddress must be in lower case and without dashes. For exemple, if your card has a MAC address 00-18-56-50-ef-f9, the section should be named [00185650eff9].

All keys described bellow are searched first in the section specific to the Eye-Fi card, then, if not found, it is search in the global [EyeFiServer] section.

You don't need card specific section if you have only one Eye-Fi card.

There is only one compulsory key, the upload_key. See bellow.

KEYS

loglevel    This defines the verbosity of the server. Valid values are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR and FATAL.
            Default value is DEBUG.
			This is the one exception to section behavior as this key is only allowed in the [EyeFiServer] global section.
upload_dir 	This is the location where the files from the Eye-Fi card will be put.
	        Starting ~ will be replace by user home directory.
	        %X will be replaced by a datetime fragment according to python time.strftime format: For exemple, on January 1st 2013, running as www-data, upload_dir=~/eyefi/%Y/%Y%m%d will put files in /var/www/eyefi/2013/20130101/
	        See http://docs.python.org/library/time.html#time.strftime
	        Default value is ~/eyefi.

            Exemple on linux:
            execute=/usr/bin/display
upload_key  To use this script you need to have your Eye-Fi upload key.
            You can find it after configuring the card, which you can currently on do only on windows or mac
            Windows: see C:\\Documents and Settings\\<User>\\Application Data\\Eye-Fi\\Settings.xml
            Mac: ~/Applications Data/Eye-Fi/Settings.xml
use_date_from_file  
            This can be On or Off.
            upload_dir key might contain variable parts such as %Y%m%d, that are replaced by the datetime values.
            If use_date_from_file is On, the reference date will be the one the picture was taken rather than the transfer date.
